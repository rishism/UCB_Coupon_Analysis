# Problem

For bar coupon and coffee coupon offers, what users were more likely to accept (use) the coupon (eg we were able to drive an action to).  Explore what characteristics had the most acceptance, and what patterns we might be able use in the future to drive the most utilization of our coupon marketing campaigns.

# *Final Summary*

Findings: 

1. Less than a quarter of people visit Bars more than 3 times a month. 
2. Regular visitors over age 25 accept coupons more over those under25 and/or non-regulars.
3. Acceptance rate is higher for for those who go to bar 1 or more times with passenger other than Kids.
4. Coupon acceptance rate is close to 50% among those who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.
5. In cold weather, Carry Out coupons have Highest Acceptance rate compared to other coupons.

Next steps:
 - Further analysis should be done to interstand acceptance rates by age groups and direction of travel compared with direction of coupon venue.

Recommendations:
 - Above shows that acceptance rate is highest among younger people and decreases as age increases until age of 40. The coupon count is least in 'below21' age group, so company can focus on providing more coupons to below21s.
 - Acceptance rate for Coffee coupons is not good among people over 30 years old. 31-45 year olds receive Coffee coupons more than any other coupons. The company can focus on providing more of Carry-Out and Restaurant-less-than-$20 Coupons to people over 30 years old as acceptance rate is good for these coupons and company may reduce number of coffee coupons they are providing.
- Dataset shows that Coupons in Opposite direction are highly accepted Only when going to a Non-Urgent place. Otherwise, coupons in same direction are preferred. Dataset shows that when going Home or to Work, More coupons are provided in Opposite direction. Based on analysis, providing more coupons in same direction will show more Acceptance.


Next Steps:

Explore age and other demographics information to see if we define a tighter cohort.

To validate: Run an experiment target people between 2PM -10pm that are headed home or no destination and not alone, 
Possible analysis to see if there behavior change vs other coupon types around "entertainment": 
1. Coffee coupon vs resturaunt
2. Coffee coupon vs take away/carry out 
3. Coffee coupon vs bar
